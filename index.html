    <p>Like many other city churches, a dwindling congregation has hurt St. Mark’s Episcopal Church's financial reserves. Now, the church is considering selling its prized backyard, a beloved open space used by the Jackson Heights community, to a developer for luxury housing.</p>
        
    <p>Many residents of the neighborhood oppose, and are coming together to find other solutions. When Sonya Gropman heard of the church’s plans, she started a petition to urge the city to buy it instead. This was two years ago. Now, her fears have come to pass with the church actively/seriously looking for a buyer.</p>

    <p>The church published a letter late last month acknowledging their plans. “The purpose of our ongoing conversations is to consider the development and possible sale of the vacant lot behind the church at 33-50 82nd St. to sustain its century-long ministry in the community,” the letter read, referring to their conversations with the Episcopal Real Estate of Long Island, the oversight entity that would need to approve any sale.</p>

    <p>The church’s backyard is considered a community oasis, used for barbecues, easter egg hunts, flea markets, and family fairs, among other events that are open to everyone. The space is also used by Farm Spot, a community supported agriculture program that operates here to distribute their produce once a week.</p>

    <p>“For this space to be turned into an apartment building would be a travesty. If the city was able to buy this piece of property, it could be turned into something with public access, and it would stay an open green space,” said Gropman, who is the coordinator of Farm Spot.</p>

    <p>This is not the first time the neighborhood has found itself at the brink of losing an open green space. In 2012, the Garden School, a K-12 school, located in East Elmhurst and Jackson heights, was planning on selling their property to a developer with a high rise apartment. Following protests by the neighborhood, the then council member Danny Dromm, along with community groups like the Green Alliance and the Jackson Heights Beautification Group, was able to get Mayor Mike Bloomberg’s attention, and a deal was struck with the city. The space was bought by the Parks Department and added to Travers Park, one of the only open green spaces in the area.</p>

    <p>The Historic District was modeled by the Queensborough Corporation, as a garden city project, with communal gardens attached to the co-op apartments.These however are private, and few people can get access to them. Over 16,000 acres of New York City is covered by parks, but park acreage is not distributed equally across the city.</p> 
            
    <p>Jackson Heights ranks 47 out of the 59 community districts when it comes to residents living within walking distance of a park or open space, according to the Queens Community District Profile by the NYC Planning department.</p>

    <p>The city’s involvement over the church’s property has become one of the major points of discussion in the community.</p>

    <p>Many took to social media/neighborhood facebook groups to raise questions about whether there exists enough infrastructure to support future residents, in the event that it becomes an apartment building.</p>

    <p>“What about sewage, what about public transport?” said Melissa Zavala, who works as an urban anthropologist. She has helped take care of the church’s gardens for many years.</p>

    <p>“The value of St Mark's lot is not just that it's the last open plot in the neighborhood, but that it also means a porous surface,” she said, pointing to its role in absorbing rainwater. If this open soil is lost to concrete, it would cause a serious strain on the sewage system.</p>

    <p>Not everybody in the community agrees that selling the land to the city would be the way to go. Some members expressed concerns about the possibility that the city might not maintain the space as a park, but transfer its ownership to another government authority.</p>

    <p>“The city could make it a very low level housing or a shelter and we have three co-ops and a school in the area, that would be jeopardized,” said Chester Hicks, a member of the vestry at St. Mark’s.</p>

    <p>Others seem more concerned regarding the financial considerations of the situation.</p>

    <p>“I don’t think the church will object if the city is interested in it, but will they be able to pay it's worth? If this costs $3, and the city or whoever wants to buy it wants to give only 50 cents, unfortunately, we will say no,” said Priest Pedro Cuevas, rector at St. Mark’s.</p>

    <p>The formal process of reaching out to the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) was started a few months ago in late spring, according to Chuck Park, Chief of Staff for Council Member Shekhar Krishnan, whose district includes Jackson Heights, East Elmhurst, and North Corona. He is also the chair of the NYC Council Committee on Parks and Recreation.</p>

    <p>When asked about the market value of the church’s land and where the sale process currently remains, the Director of Asset Management for the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island, said she didn’t have any answers yet.</p>
